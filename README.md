# adventofcode

This is the repository of Bert de Bruijn for the Advent of Code challenges (https://adventofcode.com).

The goal of this repo is to have the solutions to the puzzles in here, together with their input. 
Next to this, I plan on adding tests for checking that the solutions give the right answer. These
tests are used to make sure future changes to the shared utility folder don't break older puzzles.
